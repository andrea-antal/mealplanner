  "ingredients": [
    "1 medium butternut squash (about 2.5 lbs), peeled, seeded, and cut into 1-inch cubes",
    "3 large carrots (about 12 oz), peeled and cut into 1-inch pieces",
    "1 large yellow onion, roughly chopped",
    "4 cloves garlic, peeled",
    "3 tablespoons olive oil",
    "1 teaspoon salt, divided",
    "1/2 teaspoon black pepper",
    "4 cups vegetable broth",
    "1/2 teaspoon ground cumin",
    "1/4 teaspoon ground cinnamon",
    "1/4 teaspoon ground nutmeg",
    "1/2 cup heavy cream or coconut milk",
    "1 tablespoon maple syrup or honey",
    "2 tablespoons fresh thyme leaves (optional)",
    "Pumpkin seeds for garnish (optional)"
  ],
  "instructions": "1. Preheat oven to 425\u00b0F (220\u00b0C) and line two large baking sheets with parchment paper. 2. Spread butternut squash cubes, carrot pieces, chopped onion, and garlic cloves on the baking sheets. Drizzle with olive oil and sprinkle with 1/2 teaspoon salt and black pepper. Toss to coat evenly. 3. Roast for 30-35 minutes, stirring halfway through, until vegetables are tender and caramelized at the edges. 4. Transfer roasted vegetables to a large pot or Dutch oven. Add vegetable broth, cumin, cinnamon, nutmeg, and remaining 1/2 teaspoon salt. 5. Bring to a boil over medium-high heat, then reduce heat and simmer for 10 minutes to allow flavors to meld. 6. Using an immersion blender, puree the soup until completely smooth and creamy. Alternatively, carefully transfer in batches to a countertop blender and blend until smooth, then return to pot. 7. Stir in heavy cream and maple syrup. Taste and adjust seasoning with additional salt and pepper if needed. 8. Heat through for 2-3 minutes over low heat. Serve hot, garnished with fresh thyme leaves and pumpkin seeds if desired.",
