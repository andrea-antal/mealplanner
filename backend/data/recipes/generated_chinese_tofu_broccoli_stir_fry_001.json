  "ingredients": [
    "14 oz firm tofu, pressed and cut into 3/4-inch cubes",
    "1 lb broccoli, cut into florets",
    "4 green onions, cut into 1-inch pieces (white and green parts separated)",
    "3 tablespoons vegetable oil, divided",
    "4 cloves garlic, minced",
    "3 tablespoons soy sauce",
    "2 tablespoons oyster sauce",
    "1 tablespoon rice vinegar",
    "1 tablespoon cornstarch",

    "1 teaspoon sesame oil",
    "1 teaspoon sugar",
    "1/4 teaspoon white pepper",
    "1 teaspoon fresh ginger, minced (optional)"
  ],
  "instructions": "1. Press tofu between paper towels for 10 minutes to remove excess moisture, then cut into 3/4-inch cubes. 2. In a small bowl, whisk together soy sauce, oyster sauce, rice vinegar, cornstarch, water, sesame oil, sugar, and white pepper; set aside. 3. Heat 2 tablespoons vegetable oil in a large wok or skillet over medium-high heat. Add tofu cubes in a single layer and cook undisturbed for 3-4 minutes until golden brown on the bottom. Flip and cook another 2-3 minutes until crispy on multiple sides. Remove tofu and set aside. 4. Add remaining 1 tablespoon oil to the same pan. Add broccoli florets and stir-fry for 2 minutes. Add 2 tablespoons water, cover, and steam for 2-3 minutes until broccoli is bright green and tender-crisp. 5. Push broccoli to the sides of the pan. Add minced garlic, ginger (if using), and white parts of green onions to the center. Stir-fry for 30 seconds until fragrant. 6. Return tofu to the pan. Pour the sauce mixture over everything and toss to coat. Cook for 1-2 minutes, stirring constantly, until sauce thickens and coats the tofu and broccoli. 7. Add green parts of green onions and toss for 30 seconds. 8. Serve immediately over steamed rice.",
