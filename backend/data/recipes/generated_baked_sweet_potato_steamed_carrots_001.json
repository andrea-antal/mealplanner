  "title": "Simple baked sweet potato with steamed carrots",
  "ingredients": [
    "4 medium sweet potatoes (about 2 pounds total)",
    "1 pound carrots, peeled and cut into 2-inch pieces",
    "3 tablespoons unsalted butter, divided",
    "2 tablespoons olive oil",
    "1 teaspoon salt, divided",
    "1/2 teaspoon black pepper, divided",
    "1 tablespoon fresh parsley, chopped (or 1 teaspoon dried)",
    "1/2 teaspoon garlic powder (optional)",
    "1 tablespoon honey or maple syrup (optional, for drizzling)"
  ],
  "instructions": "1. Preheat your oven to 400\u00b0F (200\u00b0C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper or aluminum foil. 2. Scrub the sweet potatoes thoroughly under running water and pat dry. Pierce each potato 4-5 times with a fork to allow steam to escape during baking. 3. Rub each sweet potato with olive oil and sprinkle with 1/2 teaspoon of salt and 1/4 teaspoon of pepper. Place them on the prepared baking sheet. 4. Bake the sweet potatoes for 45-55 minutes, or until they are tender when pierced with a fork. The exact time will depend on the size of your potatoes. 5. While the sweet potatoes are baking, prepare the carrots. About 15 minutes before the potatoes are done, fill a medium pot with 1-2 inches of water and place a steamer basket inside. Bring the water to a boil over high heat. 6. Add the carrot pieces to the steamer basket, cover with a lid, and steam for 8-12 minutes until tender but still slightly firm. Check by piercing with a fork. 7. Once the carrots are done, drain any excess water and return them to the pot. Add 2 tablespoons of butter, remaining 1/2 teaspoon salt, remaining 1/4 teaspoon pepper, and parsley. Toss gently to coat. 8. When the sweet potatoes are done, remove them from the oven and let cool for 2-3 minutes. Cut a slit lengthwise down the center of each potato and gently press the ends to open. 9. Top each sweet potato with a small pat of the remaining butter (about 1/4 tablespoon each) and optional garlic powder. Drizzle with honey or maple syrup if desired. 10. Serve the baked sweet potatoes alongside the steamed carrots on individual plates or a serving platter. Enjoy immediately while hot.",
