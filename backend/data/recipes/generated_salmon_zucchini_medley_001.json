    "4 salmon fillets (6 oz each)",
    "2 medium zucchini, sliced into half-moons",
    "1 large white onion, thinly sliced",
    "3 tablespoons olive oil, divided",

  "instructions": "1. Pat salmon fillets dry and season both sides generously with salt, pepper, and thyme. Let rest at room temperature for 10 minutes. 2. Heat 1 tablespoon olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add sliced onions with a pinch of salt and cook for 8-10 minutes, stirring occasionally, until golden and caramelized. Transfer to a plate. 3. In the same skillet, add 1 tablespoon olive oil and increase heat to medium-high. Add zucchini slices in a single layer, season with salt and pepper, and cook for 3-4 minutes per side until golden brown. Add minced garlic and cook for 1 minute. Return onions to the pan, toss together, and transfer vegetables to a serving platter. 4. Wipe the skillet clean and heat remaining 1 tablespoon olive oil over medium-high heat. Place salmon fillets skin-side up and cook for 4-5 minutes until golden crust forms. Flip and cook for 3-4 minutes more until salmon reaches desired doneness. 5. Remove salmon from heat and transfer to the vegetable platter. In the same skillet, reduce heat to low, add butter, lemon juice, and lemon zest. Swirl until butter melts and sauce combines. 6. Drizzle lemon butter sauce over salmon and vegetables. Garnish with fresh parsley if desired and serve immediately.",
