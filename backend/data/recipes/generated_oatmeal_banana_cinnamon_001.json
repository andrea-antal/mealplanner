  "title": "Oatmeal with banana and cinnamon",
  "ingredients": [
    "2 cups rolled oats (old-fashioned oats)",
    "4 cups milk (dairy or plant-based)",
    "2 cups water",
    "1/4 teaspoon salt",
    "3 ripe bananas",
    "2 tablespoons butter or coconut oil",
    "2 teaspoons ground cinnamon",
    "2 tablespoons honey or maple syrup (optional)",
    "1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract",
    "Pinch of nutmeg (optional)"
  ],
  "instructions": "1. In a medium saucepan, combine the rolled oats, milk, water, and salt. Bring to a boil over medium-high heat, stirring occasionally. 2. Once boiling, reduce heat to low and simmer for 5-7 minutes, stirring frequently, until the oats are creamy and have absorbed most of the liquid. 3. While the oats cook, slice 2 bananas into rounds about 1/4-inch thick. Dice the remaining banana into small pieces. 4. In a separate skillet, melt the butter over medium heat. Add the sliced bananas and cook for 2-3 minutes per side until golden and slightly caramelized. 5. Sprinkle 1 teaspoon of cinnamon over the cooking bananas and gently toss. 6. Once the oatmeal is done, remove from heat and stir in the vanilla extract, diced banana, and remaining 1 teaspoon of cinnamon. Add honey or maple syrup if desired for extra sweetness. 7. Divide the oatmeal among 4 bowls. Top each serving with the caramelized banana slices. 8. Sprinkle with additional cinnamon and a pinch of nutmeg if desired. Serve immediately while hot.",
