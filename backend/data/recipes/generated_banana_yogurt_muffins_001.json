  "title": "Banana Greek Yogurt Muffins",
  "ingredients": [
    "3 ripe bananas, mashed",
    "1 cup Greek yogurt",
    "2 cups all purpose flour",
    "2 large eggs",
    "1/2 cup granulated sugar",
    "1/4 cup vegetable oil",
    "1 1/2 teaspoons baking powder",
    "1/2 teaspoon baking soda",
    "1/2 teaspoon salt",
    "1 teaspoon vanilla extract",
    "1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon"
  ],
  "instructions": "1. Preheat oven to 350\u00b0F (175\u00b0C) and line a 12-cup muffin tin with paper liners or grease well. 2. In a large bowl, mash the bananas until smooth. Add Greek yogurt, eggs, sugar, oil, and vanilla extract. Mix until well combined. 3. In a separate bowl, whisk together flour, baking powder, baking soda, salt, and cinnamon. 4. Add the dry ingredients to the wet ingredients and stir gently until just combined. Do not overmix; some lumps are okay. 5. Divide batter evenly among the 12 muffin cups, filling each about 2/3 full. 6. Bake for 20-22 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean and tops are golden brown. 7. Remove from oven and let cool in the pan for 5 minutes, then transfer muffins to a wire rack to cool completely. 8. Store in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 3 days or refrigerate for up to 1 week.",
